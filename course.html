				<h1>My Course Experience</h1>
				<p>Currently, I have some experience with both client-side code, as well as server-side code. At work, I deal
				with both aspects, but we have tended to use the traditional web app model, as well as the web server model,
				so I don't have much experience with the modern web app model of interaction between client and server</p>
				<p>I tend to work more on the server-side code, specifically with how our website connects up to our Salesforce database</p>
				<p>The languages I am familiar with related to client side web development are (in order from most to least comfortable):</p>
				<ol>
					<li>HTML</li>
					<li>Javascript</li>
					<li>CSS</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The languages I am familiar with related to server side web development are (in order from most to least comfortable):</p>
				<ol>
					<li>C#</li>
					<li>SOQL(Salesforce Proprietary language)</li>
					<li>APEX(Salesforce Proprietary language)</li>
					<li>SQL</li>
					<li>PHP</li>				
				</ol>

				<h1>What I Hope to Learn</h1>
				<p>I am taking this course to improve my skills with client-side programming, and to learn more about modern web app architecture.
				In addition, I want to learn about web frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular, because I currently do not have much experience with any
				of them except a bit with Angular.</p>
